# OOD Rules

## Compiling and viewing the presentation

The core of the talk is in `talk.rst` and is intended to be processed by [hovercraft](https://hovercraft.readthedocs.org/) (which converts ReStructuredText into [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js) presentations) - so:

```
pip3 install hovercraft
hovercraft talk.rst talk
```

And you will have the talk and associated files opened in the directory `talk/`

`hovercraft talk.rst` will compile the presentation and open it in your browser.  You can then make it full screen and press space to go through the slides.

While [notes.md](notes.md) contains notes not shown on screen - I read them on my phone while presenting.
